    "In this assignment, you will use a dataset dictionary “data_RSA.npy”. This dictionary contains 4 arrays, named ['model1', 'model2', 'model3', 'fMRI']. In each array, each row corresponds to an experimental trial (total of 60 trials), and each column corresponds to a feature. In the ‘fMRI’ array, each feature represents a voxel. In all the other arrays, each feature represents some features extracted from the trial by a computational model. In this experiment, there were 60 trials divided into X conditions, and each condition was repeated Y times."
